Blabber App – A Twitter Remake

  -Technologies: C#, HTML, Razor Pages, SQL
  
  -Type: Group Project (Weber State University)
  
  -Blabber is a social media web application inspired by Twitter, designed to allow users to create, share, and interact with short text-based posts. Built as a group project during my Computer Science degree, Blabber demonstrates the ability to design and implement full-stack web applications using modern frameworks and database integration.
  
  -Key features include:
  
    -User Authentication: Account creation, login, and session management.
    
    -Post Creation and Management: Users can create, edit, and delete short posts (“blabs”).
    
    -Feed System: Posts are displayed in chronological order, with live updates.
    
    -Database Integration: SQL database used to store user data, posts, and interactions.
    
    -Responsive Design: Razor Pages and HTML used to create an accessible, user-friendly interface.
    
  -My Contributions:
  
    -I collaborated with my team to develop both back-end and front-end components. My primary responsibilities included working with C# and SQL to implement database queries, structuring the Razor Pages for user interactions, and ensuring  smooth integration between the front-end UI and back-end logic.
    
  -Through this project, I gained valuable experience in teamwork, version control, and full-stack development, while strengthening my understanding of software design patterns and web technologies.

Company Game – Business Simulation App
  Technologies: Python, Django
  Type: Individual School Project
  Company Game is a web-based simulation game where players purchase companies, progress through days, and generate revenue to expand their portfolios. Designed and fully developed by me using Python and Django, the project showcases both back-end logic and front-end integration to deliver a functional and engaging user experience.
  Key features include:
    Dynamic Progression System: Players can advance time, triggering revenue updates across owned companies.
    Economy Simulation: Profit scaling and reinvestment mechanics encourage strategic growth.
    Company Marketplace: Users can buy new companies as they accumulate wealth.
    Database-Driven Design: Django models track companies, user accounts, and game states.
    Scalable Architecture: Built to support expansion with additional company types and mechanics.
  This project gave me hands-on experience with full-stack development in Django, including building models, views, and templates, while reinforcing my ability to handle both business logic and user-facing functionality.
