Blabber App – A Twitter Remake

Technologies: C#, HTML, Razor Pages, SQL
Type: Group Project (Weber State University)

Blabber is a social media web application inspired by Twitter, designed to allow users to create, share, and interact with short text-based posts. Built as a group project during my Computer Science degree, Blabber demonstrates the ability to design and implement full-stack web applications using modern frameworks and database integration.

Key features include:

User Authentication: Account creation, login, and session management.

Post Creation and Management: Users can create, edit, and delete short posts (“blabs”).

Feed System: Posts are displayed in chronological order, with live updates.

Database Integration: SQL database used to store user data, posts, and interactions.

Responsive Design: Razor Pages and HTML used to create an accessible, user-friendly interface.

My Contributions:
I collaborated with my team to develop both back-end and front-end components. My primary responsibilities included working with C# and SQL to implement database queries, structuring the Razor Pages for user interactions, and ensuring smooth integration between the front-end UI and back-end logic.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in teamwork, version control, and full-stack development, while strengthening my understanding of software design patterns and web technologies.
